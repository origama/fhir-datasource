@Authors: Giuseppe Virz√¨, Scuderi Giovanni Luca

### Current Status

Main Status: DRAFT

#### Features

- Configuration Panel : DRAFT
- All other panels are missing

### Developer TIPS

It is developed by merging concepts from the Grafana GitHub datasource template.
We switched from Grunt to Webpack.

We discovered a clean template here: 
https://github.com/CorpGlory/grafana-plugin-template-webpack-typescript

We made a much simpler docker-compose file to test the plugin locally.
You can find it in dockerTest:
 - base image selected
 - Grafana plugins volume is mounted on local dist
 - port binding on 127.0.0.1:3000
