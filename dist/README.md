Main Status: DRAFT

### Developer TIPS

It is developed by merging concepts from the Grafana GitHub datasource template.
We switched from Grunt to Webpack.
The project now targets **Node.js 20** and **TypeScript 5** and works with Grafana 9.

We discovered a clean template here: 
https://github.com/CorpGlory/grafana-plugin-template-webpack-typescript

We made a much simpler docker-compose file to test the plugin locally.
You can find it in dockerTest:
 - base image selected
 - Grafana plugins volume is mounted on local dist
 - port binding on 127.0.0.1:3000

An extended compose file `docker-compose-grafana-hapi.yml` is available
for local development. It starts Grafana together with a HAPI FHIR server
preloaded with a few synthetic resources so you can try the datasource
without any external dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose -f dockerTest/docker-compose-grafana-hapi.yml up
```
